# Tabula muris - the importance of sharing comprehensive datasets to connect the dots

> Frictionless data sharing is what motivates us (Olga Botvinnik (@olgabot), CZ Biohub data scientist)

The Tabula Muris is a compendium of single cell transcriptome data from the model organism Mus musculus comprising more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues.  These data represent a new resource for cell biology, revealing gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and allowing for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as T-lymphocytes and endothelial cells from distinct anatomical locations.

This Mouse Atlas has many uses, including the discovery of new putative cell types, the discovery of novel gene expression in known cell types, and the ability to compare cell types across organs and tissues.  It will also serve as a reference of healthy young adult organs and tissues which can be used as a baseline for current and future mouse models of disease. While it is not an exhaustive characterization of all organs of the mouse, it does provide a rich data set of many of the most populous and important cell populations within the mouse, and represents a foundation for future studies across a multitude of diverse physiological disciplines. 

As such a resource is only useful if it can be fully used by the community, we released the data (figshare?) and the code (GitHub,+?)
